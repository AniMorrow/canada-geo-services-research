      <name>Flood : British Columbia</name>
      <description>British Columbia, June 16-25, 1999.  Flooding on the Skeena in the northwestern part of BC closed roads and highways, and forced 30 people from their homes in Old Remo on June 18. Other cities affected included Hazelton, Usk, Terrace, and Kitimat.  The South Thompson river rose until June 25 and caused only localised flooding.  The Clearwater river in central BC forced 88 people from their homes in Clearwater and Barriere on Sun June 20.  The Fraser river peaked just below 1997 flood levels of 6.5 m and caused low lying areas to flood until June 25.  All the flooding is blamed on the high snowfall of the previous winter.</description>

      <name>Flood : Peace River area BC</name>
      <description>Peace River area BC, June 2001.  The region was subjected to many intense precipitation events.  Increased tributary levels combined with the spring freshet caused the over-saturation of the soil and surface runoff.  This in turn triggered several landslides that cut-off highways.  Property and infrastructure damage was extensive. Pink Mountain and Halfway River were both affected.</description>

      <description>Northwestern British Columbia, October 29 - November 7, 1978. Northwestern BC was hit by two floods. The first was due to a major storm system which struck October 29 to November 1. The second flood was caused by heavy rainfall and mixture of snow and rain occurring between November 4 and 7. Flooding occurred collectively along the Skeena and Nass rivers, and on the Queen Charlotte Islands. The Terrace-Kitimat region was declared a disaster area as the local economy was severely disrupted by the flooding and loss of communication links. Kitimaat Village and Thornhill were also affected while Lakelse Lake and Old Remo areas were the worst hit by flooding with dozens of homes flooded.  Numerous bridges were damaged and destroyed, roads and highways were washed out in many places, and the railway line between Smithers and Terrace was closed because of the flooding. A CN Rail track was undermined ? a train engine fell into the Skeena River, causing the deaths of two people.</description>

More than 70 mm of precipitation from a low-pressure weather system combined with spring snowmelt caused widespread flooding in Upper Liard, Yukon, Nahanni Butte, Northwest Territories, and Lower Post, British Columbia. Approximately 20 people from Upper Liard, 80 people from Nahanni Butte, and 37 people from Lower Post were evacuated. Approximately 2,500 people, including over 300 commercial transport trucks, experienced traffic delays in the region because of highway washouts.

      <description>Northeastern British Columbia, June 15-17, 2016. Heavy rainfall throughout the Peace River region in northeastern British Columbia caused flooding in several communities. The district of Chetwynd declared a local state of emergency on June 15 after Chetwynd had received a total of 134.8 mm of rain over a two-day period. A section of Highway 97, the only route that connects the region of Peace River to the rest of the province, was closed due to flooding. The hardest hit by the flooding was the city of Dawson Creek where up to 98.6 mm of rain fell over a two-day period. In Dawson Creek, 60 people evacuated their homes due to flood waters that damaged approximately 400 homes, destroyed one bridge and submerged two others. The flooding in Dawson Creek cut the city in half, leaving residents in the south end of the city without power as well as separating the hospital from the fire hall, which created a challenge for emergency responders. In total, over 2000 homes and businesses (approximately 6000 individuals) were without power throughout the Peace River region as of June 15.</description>

      <description>Following a relatively cold and dry winter, the Southern Interior region of British Columbia experienced a wetter than average spring. A late snowfall and rain accumulation led to saturated soils, overland flow, and slope instability throughout areas of the south and central Okanagan as well as the Kootenay and Shuswap regions. The flooding led to 2,500 evacuations which were mostly from the Okanagan. Numerous States of Local Emergencies were declared. 15 First Nation communities were impacted where the flooding damaged homes and infrastructure. The flood response costs alone were estimated to be $73 million.</description>

      <name>Flood : Old Man River, Alberta</name>
      <description>In June of 1908, Old Man River in Alberta experienced one of its highest peak flows in history; caused by heavy rains and an already saturated ground because of snowmelt. On June 6th, the peak flow was estimated to be 200,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) , and 8 m (26.7 ft.) above normal river levels. Due to the floods of 1902, the river had widened, therefore the flood of 1908 had a higher volume of water but a slightly less height above normal. Regardless, the 1908 flood caused significant losses to several communities such as Lethbridge and McLeod, AB. This included a population dip in Lethbridge, significant damage to critical infrastructure  (e.g. damage to the new CPR bridge, viaduct, powerhouse, and hospital), and the destruction of many homes.</description>

Roughly 200 million cubic feet of water was released down river and into Port Arthur, ON. As a result, the floodwaters destroyed kilometres of Canadian Pacific Railway tracks, caused other property and infrastructure damage, and derailed a freight train. The dam failure killed 5 individuals, all of whom were on the freight train, and caused an estimated $500,000 (1908 CAD) in losses.</description>

      <description>During the last week of May, the temperatures soared to over 30 Celsius causing snowmelt and flooding conditions across BC, the Yukon and Alaska. The Skeena, Columbia and Thompson Rivers reached record levels. The Skeena River changed its course in several places including Terrace, BC, which led to severe erosion—for instance, one farm lost 4.8 ha in 3 days. The communities of Usk and Remo were significantly impacted. In Usk, the flood waters were 1.8-3 m high and only 3 buildings in the community were not damaged. In Remo, the water was 2.4 m, and only 1 house was not damaged. The Skeena River also carved new river channels including one through the community of Kispiox, and with it, 20 buildings. Several infrastructure was damaged including hundreds of meters of rail lines, at least 22 bridges, community powerhouses, 10 km of telephone and telegraph lines, kilometers of roadways and ferry infrastructure. Damage to roads, bridges and ferry infrastructure was $35,100 (CAD 1916); $21,305 alone was in the Terrace-Kitwanga area.</description>
